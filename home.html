            <p>Creating a community page as part of the customizer website and point of sale system for Okoppi Journals. It will have journals made by other users (using the customizer) displayed to the community that users can purchase or save for later.</p>

            <h2>Month 1</h2>
            <p>Over the past month, our team has focused on laying the foundation for its community pageâ€”a space where users can explore, edit, save, and purchase bullet journal designs. This phase involved extensive conceptualization, collaboration with the client, and overcoming technical challenges as the team adapted to a new tech stack, including React, Next.js, MongoDB, Vercel, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn. A key milestone was finalizing the design direction, incorporating journal previews, interactive buttons, hoverable elements, a navigation bar, a simple filter, and a bookmark animation. The homepage was successfully developed with core components like journal previews, filtering, and navigation, setting the stage for the next development phase.</p>
